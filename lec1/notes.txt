Peak Finding Problem (1d):
        1       2       3       4       5       ...     n
        x       x       x       x       x       x       x
        Problem: 
                -find A peak if it exists in the array A from 1 to n such that
                 a[x-1] <= a[x] >= a[x+1]         
        Solutions:
        - Compare all elements O(n)
        - Divide and Conquer O(lg(n))
                - T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) => O(lg(n))

Peak Finding Problem (2d):
        - greater than surrounds
        
        Solutions:
                - Gready Ascent O(mn) -> O(n^2)
                - Divide and Conquer
